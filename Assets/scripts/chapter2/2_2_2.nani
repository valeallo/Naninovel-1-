Felix: I’d say that your work ethic is really poor. 
Me: But you would eat it anyway, right? 
Felix: Maybe, if there’s some coffee too… 
Me: ... 
Felix: I’m kidding, I’m kidding…

(Felix grabs the cupcake from my hands and begins to eat it slowly, as if he is trying not to show any sign of enjoyment.)
(The silence is filled just by the sound of Felix chewing, as an awkward mist clouds around us.)

Me: So… will you tell me what’s gotten into you this morning? 
@style i
(Felix almost chokes on his muffin, caught off guard by my question. I can notice him starting to blush a little.)
@style default
Felix: It was nothing, I’m sorry I overreacted like that. I had time to calm down. 
Me: Come on Felix, I don’t want you to be mad at me forever. 
Felix: I won’t be. 
Me: But you are right now. 
@style i
(Felix doesn’t respond. He just continues eating avoiding looking in my direction.)
(Whatever. I’m determined to know what his problem is, and I won’t move from my seat until I do.) 
(Even if it means I have to keep staring at him as he eats.)
(And apparently, that does the trick.)

Felix: You didn’t answer my calls. 
Me: What? What are you talking about? 
Felix: I called you, like, at least ten times the night we went to the karaoke and you didn’t pick up even once. Neither you called me for the whole weekend. 
Felix: When I left you barely realized, you were all too preoccupied having fun with... the others.
Felix: You didn’t even warn me if you got home safely, I didn’t know where you were and for a moment I got really worried. 
Felix: It’s just that… sometimes you’re so absent-minded and I… I don’t know… 
Felix: I mean… I’m not your mother, I don't have any right to blame you for anything.
@style i
(Felix seems to have found something interesting on his shoes since for all this time he has kept his eyes locked on them.)
(Seeing him like this makes me feel awful but thankful at the same time. I really, really don’t deserve him sometime.)
@style default
Me: No, you’re right… And I’m sorry: I wasn’t thinking straight at the moment and I acted like an idiot. 
Felix: I know you didn’t do it on purpose, or at least I hoped so... but I couldn’t help feeling bad about it. I just felt left out.
Felix: But it's childish of me to blame you for that.
@style i
(Felix’s voice is soft and gentle, which makes me feel even worse. Why does he have to be so kind?)
@style default
Me: I’m so lucky to have you watching out for me, even if I keep on making mistakes. 
Felix: … 
Me: … 

; *blush* 
@style default
Felix: O-okay, all forgotten. Don’t be cheesy now… 
@style i
(The atmosphere lightens up a little, and Felix finally looks at me, smiling slightly.)
@style default
Me: I swear I’ll try to be a better friend to you from now on! 
Felix: I get it, that’s… that’s enough. 
Me: You’re such a great guy, Felix! 
@style i
(At this point, I think the conversation has lost every trace of seriousness.)
(I just laugh, amused by the embarrassed look that starts to form on Felix’s face, which really dares me to continue saying these soppy things.)
@style default
Felix: Ah, seriously… 
Felix: Let’s just forget about it, okay? 
Felix: If you want, we can hang out after I finish with the inventory.

Felix: I heard they opened the ice rink in town, we can go check it out. 
Me: All right, I'll go change and wait for you. 
Felix: Sounds like a plan, I am almost done.

(I feel completely drained after this day, I really need to rest.)
@style default
Felix: Yeah, sure. Then I'll see you. 
Me: Sure, bye Felix. Remember that you are special to me! 
@style i
(I blow a kiss his way and I really have to hold back from winking at him.)
(His flushing red face is totally worth getting a few looks from some customers.)
@style default
Felix: Pfff, just go already.

(Finally, I leave the café and make my way home.)
